Tackling Data Drift in Recommendation Systems with KL Divergence



Data Drift in Production Environments is a phenomenon where the statistical characteristics of input data evolve over time—can subtly yet significantly undermine the performance of ML models. This risk is particularly pronounced in recommendation systems, where capturing the nuances of ever-changing user behavior is critical for maintaining relevance.



Turning to Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence—a statistical measure that quantifies the difference between two probability distributions. KL Divergence's sensitivity to even subtle shifts makes it an excellent tool for monitoring data drift in features like:

- Total Spend

- Items Purchased

- Days Since Last Purchase

By comparing training data (reference distribution) to live production data, I could track when data began to deviate significantly, flagging potential risks to the model’s performance.
